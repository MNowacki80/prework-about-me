      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an accomplished and experienced journalist and content creator who has decided to bite off, quite possibly, more than I can chew.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, and love all things Cleveland. My family moved to the Gulf Coast of Florida when I was in high school.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Sports enthusiast but hold Liverpool FC, FSU and Cleveland baseball closest to my heart. Enjoy the outdoors, binging Ozark, and telling terrible dad jokes.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To work for a sports entity in the digital space (I'm old now, though, so maybe a digital job in banking is more my speed :)).</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Huntersville, North Carolina</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Looking for that new challenge to get me out of my comfort zone and this definitely is that.</p>
