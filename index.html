      <p>I'm an accomplished and expereinced journalist and content creator who has decided to bite off, quite possibly, more than I can chew.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, and love all things Cleveland. My family moved to the Gulf Coast of Florida when I was in high school and I've been living in Charlotte for the last 14 years.</p>
